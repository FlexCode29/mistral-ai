# Table extractor

This code uses mistral to extract table data from an html, and provides added flexibility since it is not CSS-selector dependent. It only works for short websites due to the 130k context window.




## Getting Started

For localhost, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
